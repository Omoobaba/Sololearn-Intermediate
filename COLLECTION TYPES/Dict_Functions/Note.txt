To determine whether a key is in a dictionary, you can use 'in' and 'not in', just as you can for a list.
The 'get' function does the same thing as indexing, but in the dictionary it returns another specified value instead.
To determine how many items a dictionary has, use the len() function.
For the get() function, it prints the specified value only when the key is not an element in the variable

A get() is quite similar to:
def search(z):
    if z in data:
        return data[z]
    else:
        return "Not found"

print(search(z))

This is essentially what the get function does
