Tuples are very similar to lists, except that they are immutable (they cannot be changed). 
Also, they are created using parentheses, rather than square brackets.

You can access the values in the tuple with their index, just like lists.

EXAMPLE: words = ("spam", "eggs", "sausages").
words[1] = "eggs"

Trying to reassign a value in a tuple causes an error.

Like lists and dictionaries, tuples can be nested within each other.

Tuples can be created without the parentheses by just seperating the values with commas.

Tuples are faster than lists, but they cannot be changed. 

Tuples can be used to output multiple values from a function.
