Creating a function normally (using def) assigns it to a variable automatically.
Python allows us to create functions on the fly provided that they are created using lambda syntax.

This approach is most commonly used when passing a simple function as an argument to another function. 
The syntax consists of the lambda key word followed by a list of arguments, 
a colon, and the expression to evaluate and return.

Functions created using the lambda syntax are known as anonymous. lambdas are shorthand to create anonymous functions.

lambda functions aren't as powerful as named functions. 
They can only do things that require a single line expression - usually equivalent to a single line of code
