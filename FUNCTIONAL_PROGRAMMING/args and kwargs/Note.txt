Python allows you to have functions with varying numbers of arguments.
Using *args as a function parameter enables you to pass an arbitrary number of arguments to that function.
The arguments are then accessible as the tuples args in the body of the function.
The name args is just a convention; you can choose to use another.

**kwargs (standing for keyword arguments) allows you to handle named arguments that you have not defined in advance.
The keyword argument returns a dictionary in which the keys are the argument names, 
and the values are the argument values

It is important to note that args can't be defined after kwargs
