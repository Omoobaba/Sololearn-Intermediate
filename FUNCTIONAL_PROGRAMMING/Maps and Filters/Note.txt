The built-in functions map and filter are very useful higher-order functions 
that operate on lists (or similar objects called iterables).

The function map takes a function and an iterable as arguments, 
and returns a new iterable with the function applied to each argument.

The function filter filters an iterable by leaving only the items that match a condition (also called a predicate)
