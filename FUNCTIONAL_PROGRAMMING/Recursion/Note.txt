The fundamental part of recursion is self-reference -- functions calling themselves.
It is used to solve problems that can be broken up into easier sub-problems of the same type.

recursion can aso be indirect. one function can call a second, which call the first, which call the second, and so on.
this can occur with any number of functions.
