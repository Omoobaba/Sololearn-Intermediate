Properties provide a way of customizing access to instance attributes.
They are created by putting the property decorator above a method, which means when the instance attribute
with the same name as the method is accessed, the method will be called instead.
One common use of a property is to make an attribute read-only.

Properties can also be set by finding setter/getter functions.
The setter function sets the corresponding property's value.
The getter function gets the value.
To define a setter you need to use a decorator of the same name as the property, followed by a dot and the setter keyword.
The same applies to defining a getter function.
