More magic method for common operators:

__sub__ for -
__mul__ for * 
__truediv__ for /
__floordiv__ //
__mod__ for %
__pow__ for **
__and__ for &
__xor__ for ^
__or__ for |

The expression x + y  is translated into x.__add__(y).
However, if x hasn't implemented __add__, and x and y are of different types,
then y.__radd__(x) is called. 
There are equivalent r methods for all magic methods just mentioned
