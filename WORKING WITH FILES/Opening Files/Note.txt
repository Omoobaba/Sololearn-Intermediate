You can us e Python to read and write the contents of files.
Before a file can be edited, it must first be opened, using the open function

The argument of the open function is the path to the file. If the file is in the current working directory of the program,
you can specify only its name.

You can specify the mode used to open a file by applying a second argument to the open function.
Sending "r" means open in read mode, which is the default.
Sending "w" means write mode, for rewriting the contents of a file.
Sending "a" means append mode, for adding new content to the end of the file

Adding "b" to a mode opens it in binary mode, which is used for non-text (such as images and sound files)

Once a file has been opened and used, you should close it.
This is done with the close method of the file object
