An exception occurs when something goes wrong, due to incorrect code or input. 
When an exception occurs, the program immediately stops.

An exception is an event which occurs during the execution of a program that disrupts the normal flow of the program.

Different exceptions are raised for different reasons
Common exceptions:
ImportError: an import fails;
IndexError: a list is indexed with an out-of-range number
SyntaxError: the code can't be parsed properly because it doesn't follow python syntax;
TypeError: a function is called on a value of an inappropriate type;
ValueError: a function is called on a value of the correct type, but an inappropriate value

Python has several other built-in exceptions, such as ZeroDivisionError and OSError. 
Third-party libraries also often define their own exceptions
